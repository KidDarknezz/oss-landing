For Selina's Carnival Upside Down, we brought the visual energy to match the madness — 11 DJs, 3 beachside venues, and a wild twist on tradition.<br/><br/>We designed colorful, animated visuals inspired by the playful, surreal tone of the event, blending tropical chaos with creative freedom. The result? A vibrant campaign that felt as spontaneous and bold as the carnival itself — full of rhythm, fun, and upside-down surprises.",
